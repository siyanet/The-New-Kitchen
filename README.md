## 🍴 The Kitchen – Restaurant Management SaaS

### Overview

**The Kitchen** is a **SaaS-based Restaurant Management System** designed for restaurants to efficiently manage their branches, menus, orders, and staff — all in one place.
Each restaurant (tenant) gets its own unique domain and dashboard after registration. The platform supports multiple user roles including **Owner, Waiter, Kitchen Staff, and Customer**, ensuring a smooth workflow from order placement to delivery.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

### 🏠 Multi-Tenant Architecture

The system is built using **Django Tenants**, allowing each restaurant to operate in complete isolation with its own database schema and domain.

* Tenants register via:
  🔗 [Tenant Registration Page](https://the-new-kitchen.vercel.app/thekitchenethio/tenant_registeration)

* After successful registration, each tenant receives a unique domain like:

  ```
  https://the-new-kitchen.vercel.app/thekitchenethio/<tenant_name>/
  ```

  Example:
  `https://the-new-kitchen.vercel.app/thekitchenethio/pizzahut/`

Each tenant can then log in and manage their restaurant through their own environment — including branches, menus, and staff.

## 🌐 Tenant Registration Flow

1. Restaurant owner registers at the **Tenant Registration Page**.
2. The backend creates a **new tenant schema** with a unique slug (e.g., `pizzahut`).
3. The system assigns the tenant a unique domain path:
   `https://the-new-kitchen.vercel.app/thekitchenethio/pizzahut/`
4. The tenant can then log in and access their restaurant management dashboard.
