## Setting Up Your Development Environment

Follow these steps to set up your local development environment for this project.

## 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kuraz-RMS-Group-4/RMSFrontend.git
cd RMSFrontend
```

## 2. Install Node.js and npm

Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed. You can download Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org). npm comes bundled with Node.js.

To verify the installation, run:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## 3. Install Project Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will read the `package.json` file and install all the required dependencies for the project.

## 4. Configure Tailwind CSS

Ensure Tailwind CSS is correctly set up. If you encounter any issues, verify the following:

- The `tailwind.config.js` file includes the correct paths in the `content` property:

  ```js
  // tailwind.config.js
  module.exports = {
    content: [
      './index.html',
      './src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
    ],
    theme: {
      extend: {},
    },
    plugins: [],
  };
  ```

- The `postcss.config.js` is properly configured:

  ```js
  // postcss.config.js
  module.exports = {
    plugins: {
      tailwindcss: {},
      autoprefixer: {},
    },
  };
  ```

## 5. Start the Development Server

Run the development server to preview the application:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in the output) to see the application.

## 6. Create a Production Build

When you are ready to create a production-ready build of the application, use:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build files will be generated in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment.

## 7. Running Tests

If the project includes tests, you can run them with:

```bash
npm test
```

Check the test configuration in `package.json` or the test directory for specific instructions.

## 8. Updating Dependencies

Keep your dependencies up to date. To check for outdated packages, use:

```bash
npm outdated
```

Update them with:

```bash
npm update
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Ensure all dependencies are installed**: If you encounter issues with missing packages, re-run 
```bash
npm install
```
